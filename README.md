## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing has been done to the dataset.Before training the model, the dataset undergoes preprocessing steps including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to prepare it for training.

## Model

The model developed for this project is a Random Forest Regression model. Random Forest is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple decision trees to create a robust and accurate predictive model. The model has been tested and loaded for deployment.

## Frontend

The frontend of the application has been created using Streamlit. Streamlit is an open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science projects. It allows for easy and rapid development of web applications.

## Instructions for Running the Application Locally
